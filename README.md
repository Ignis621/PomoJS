# PomoJS
PomoJS is a simple pomodoro timer written in JavaScript. It is designed to be as minimal as possible, while still being functional. It's also designed to be as lightweight as possible, so it can be used on any device.

This project uses
- The [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) (Mocha) color palette
- [Material Product Sounds](https://m2.material.io/design/sound/sound-resources.html) by Google

## About the code
Oh, the code that's not for the faint of heart,  
Beware, for it might tear your mind apart.  
The warning's clear, it's not the best,  
A newbie's work, put to the test.

Despite its flaws, it gets the job done,  
So use with care, for it's not much fun.  
JavaScript's tricky, we all know,  
But with practice, your code will glow.
